# LESSON 01 - Building Programs With Python

These notes are a guide to the speaker, as they present the material.

## Before you start

* Test your `Jupyter` installation and make sure you can connect to the kernel.

## Slides

----
**SLIDE** Building Programs With Python (1)

----
**SLIDE** INTRODUCTION

----
**SLIDE** WHY ARE WE HERE?

* We're here to learn **how to program**
* This is a way to **solve problems in your research** through making a computer do work **quickly** and **accurately**
* You'll build **functions** that do specific, defined tasks
* You'll **automate** those functions to perform tasks over and over again (in various combinations)
* You'll **manipulate data**, which is at the heart of all academia
* You'll learn some **file input/output** to make the computer read and write useful information
* You'll learn some **Data structures**, which are ways to organise data so that the computer can deal with it efficiently

----
**SLIDE** XKCD

* This cartoon is a *little* flippant, but only a bit
* The principles of a programming language like Perl are universal
* Many concepts are **universal across programming languages**
* **Learning one programming language will speed up the process of learning others**
* **Q: HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE EXPERIENCE OF AT LEAST ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE?**
* What the more experienced here encounter should be recognisable to them

----
**SLIDE** HOW ARE WE DOING THIS?

* We'll be learning how to program **using Python**
* **Why Python?**
* We need to use *some* language
* Python is free, with good documentation and lots of books and online courses.
* Python is widely-used in academia, and there's lots of support online
* It can be easier for novices to pick up than other languages
* **We won't be covering the entire language in detail**
* **We will be using some long-handed ways of doing things to keep them clear for novices**

----
**SLIDE** NO, I MEAN "*HOW* ARE WE DOING THIS?"

* We'll use **two tools to write Python**
* The **bulk of the course will be in the `Jupyter` notebook**
* `Jupyter` is **good for exploring data, prototyping code, data-wrangling, and teaching**
* However, it's **not so good for writing "production code"** in a general sense
* So, we'll also spend a little bit of time writing code in a **text editor**
* Text editors are part of the **edit-save-execute** cycle, which is how much code is written
* There are also specialist **integrated development environments (IDEs)** for Python that are extremely useful for developers, but we'll not be using them

----
**SLIDE** DO I NEED TO USE PYTHON AFTERWARDS?

* **No.**
* The lesson and principles are general, we're just teaching in Python
* What you learn here will be relevant in other languages
* If your field or colleagues use another language in preference, **there may be very good reasons for that**, and they **may be able to offer detailed, relevant support and help to you in that language**. This is valuable.
* Language Wars waste everyone's time.

----
**SLIDE** WHAT ARE WE DOING?

* We're using **a motivating example of data analysis**
* We've got some data relating to a new treatment for arthritis, and we're going to **explore it.**
* Data represents patients and **daily measurements of inflammation**
* We're going to **analyse** the data
* We're going to **visualise** the data
* We're going to get the computer to do this for us
* **Automation** is key: **fewer human mistakes**, easier to **apply to other future datasets**, and share with others (**transparency**)
* We can also **share our code and results** *via* sites such as GitHub and BitBucket (supplementary information, impact)

----
**SLIDE** SETUP

**AT THIS POINT, PUT THE `TERMINAL` ON-SCREEN IN A SINGLE PROJECTOR SETUP, AND MOVE THE SLIDES TO THE DESKTOP**

----
**SLIDE** SETTING UP - 1 - **DEMO**

* We want a **neat (clean) working environment**: always a good idea when starting a new project - it helps for when you might want to use `git` to put it under version control, later.
* **Change directory to desktop** (in terminal or Explorer)
* **Create directory** `python-novice-inflammation`
* **Change your working directory** to that directory

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir python-novice-inflammation
cd python-novice-inflammation
```

----
**SLIDE** SETTING UP - 2 - **DEMO**

* We need to **download our data** (and also a little code that can help us)
* **Go to Etherpad in browser** [http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2017-05-18-standrews](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/2017-05-18-standrews)
* **Point out file links** [http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip)
* **Click on file links to download**
* **Move files** to `python-novice-inflammation` directory
* **Extract files** - this will create a subdirectory called `data` in that folder
* **CHECK WHETHER EVERYONE HAS EXTRACTED THE DATA**

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** GETTING STARTED

----
**SLIDE** STARTING `JUPYTER` **DEMO**

* Make sure you're in the project directory `python-novice-inflammation`
* **Start `Jupyter`** from the command-line
* **CHECK WHETHER EVERYONE SEES A WORKING JUPYTER NOTEBOOK**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** `JUPYTER` LANDING PAGE **DEMO**

* **`Jupyter` landing page is a file browser**, like Explorer/Finder
* Point out `Python` (`.py`) files, `.zip` files, and directories)
* Point out directory (`data`), and how the file symbols are different. (*the triangle by the check box gives a key*)
* **Point out `New` button.**

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK **DEMO**

* Click on `New -> Python 3`
* Point out that there may or may not be other options in the student's installation
* Indicate the new features on the empty notebook:
  * The **notebook name**: `Untitled`
  * **Checkpoint** information (the last time the notebook was saved, for safety)
  * The **menu bar** (`File Edit etc.`) - just like `Word` or `Excel`
  * An indication of **which kernel you're using/language you're in**
  * **Icon view** (just like `Word` or `Excel`)
  * An empty cell with `In [ ]:`
* Point out the **box around the cell**, and that it **changes colour** when you start to edit

----
**SLIDE** MY FIRST NOTEBOOK **DEMO**

* **Give the notebook the name `variables`**
* Click on `Untitled` and enter the name `variables`

----
**SLIDE** CELL TYPES **DEMO**

* `Jupyter` documents are comprised of `cells`
* A `cell` can be one of **several types** - we'll focus on two:
  * `Code`: **code** in the current kernel/language
  * `Markdown`: **text**, with the opportunity for formatting
* **Change the first cell type to `Markdown`**
  * The box **colour changes** from green to blue
  * The `In []` **prompt disappears**

----
**SLIDE** MARKDOWN TEXT **DEMO**

* `Markdown` lets us **enter formatted text**
  * **Headers** are preceded by a hash: `#`
  * The **level of header** is determined by the number of hashes: `#`
  * **Typewriter text/code** is shown by enclosing in backticks: ```
  * **Italics** are shown by enclosing text in single asterisks: `*italic*`
  * **LaTeX** can be entered within dollar signs `$`
* Press `Shift + Enter` to execute a cell
* The cell is rendered, and a new cell appears beneath the executed cell

```markdown
# Variables in Python

## Python as a calculator

We can use `Python` as a calculator by typing mathematical statements
into a code cell, and *executing* that cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

We will enter the statement $1 + 2$ to see the result.
```

----
**SLIDE** ENTERING CODE **DEMO**

* **Mathematical statements can be entered directly** into a code cell
  * **ENTER `1+2`**
* **Before the cell is executed, note that the `In []` prompt has no value in it**
* Note that the **code is colour syntax-highlighted**
  * **EXECUTE THE CELL** `Shift + Enter`
* Note that **after execution, the `In []` prompt now has a number in it** to indicate the order in which cells were executed
* Note also that because there is no place to put the output, **a value has been returned as `OUT [1]`**, showing the result of the calculation
* **A new code cell is created** beneath the executed cell.

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 01

* **PUT THE EXERCISE SLIDE ON SCREEN**
* **Ask the learners to try some calculator calculations, and demo some of your own**

```python
2 ** 4
48 / 2 * (9 + 3)  # AMBIGUOUS!
48 / (2 * (9 + 3))
(48 / 2) * (9 + 3)
1e3 + 1e4
6 % 2
7 / 2
7 % 2
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

**WHEN FINISHED, GO BACK TO THE NOTEBOOK AND PUT THE SLIDES ON THE DESKTOP**

----
**SLIDE** MY FIRST VARIABLE

* **TYPE THE MARKDOWN IN A CELL AND EXECUTE**
  * This is to keep the notebook as an example of literate programming (and a handy reference for the students)

```markdown
## Variables

* Variables are like *named boxes*
* An item of data goes into the box
* When we refer to the box/variable name, we get the contents of the box
```

* **Use a real-life example to hand if possible**
* You can think of a variable as a labelled box, containing a data item
  * Here, we have a box labelled `Name` - this is the variable name
  * We've put the value `Samia` into the box

----
**SLIDE** CREATING A VARIABLE

```python
name = "Samia"
```

* **LET'S DO THIS FOR REAL IN PYTHON - follow on from the physical example if possible**
  * To *assign* a value we use the *equals sign*
  * The variable name/box label goes on the left, and the data item goes on the right
  * *Character strings*, or *strings*, are enclosed in quotes
  * Executing the cell assigns the variable
* So now, if we refer to the variable `Name`, we get the value that's in the box: `Samia`

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** INSPECTING A VARIABLE

* The `print()` function shows contents of a variable
* **We refer to the name of the variable, and get its contents**

```python
print(name)
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** WORKING WITH VARIABLES

* **Lead the students** through the code:

* Note, we're assigning an integer now (no quotes), but **assignment is the same for all data items**
* Print `weight_kg` to see its value

```python
weight_kg = 55
print(weight_kg)
```

* **Variables can be substituted by name wherever a value would go**, in calculations for example

```python
2.2 * weight_kg
```

* People may ask about floating point representations here - an introduction is at [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) - put this on the Etherpad.

* **The `print()` function will take more than one argument, separated by commas, and print them**

```python
print("weight in pounds", 2.2 * weight_kg)
```

* **Reassigning to the same variable overwrites the old value**

```python
weight_kg = 57.5
print("weight in kilograms is now:", weight_kg)
```

* **Changing the value of one variable does not automatically change the values of other defined variables**

```python
print(weight_kg)
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
print('weight in kilograms:', weight_kg, 'and in pounds:', weight_lb)
weight_kg = 100
print('weight in kilograms:', weight_kg, 'and in pounds:', weight_lb)
```

* **Although we changed the value in `weight_kg`, `weight_lb` did not change when we did so**

**SLIDE** EXERCISE 02 (5MIN)

* **PUT THE EXERCISE SLIDE ON SCREEN**
**MCQ: put up four colours of sticky notes**

* The solution is `2`

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 03 (5MIN)

**MCQ: put up four colours of sticky notes**

* The code prints `Hopper Grace`

**WHEN FINISHED, GO BACK TO THE NOTEBOOK AND PUT THE SLIDES ON THE DESKTOP**

----
**SLIDE** DATA ANALYSIS

----
**SLIDE** START A NEW NOTEBOOK

* **Create a new notebook, and give it the name `analysis`**
* For this, you can introduce `File -> New Notebook -> Python 3` as a way to create a new notebook

```markdown
# Data analysis

This notebook introduces the use of `Jupyter` and `Python` for data analysis
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** EXAMINE THE DATA

* **SHOW THE TERMINAL ON SCREEN**
* Use the terminal (`head` from this morning)
 
```bash
head data/inflammation-01.csv
```

* **Describe the data**: plain text, csv format
  * One row per patient
  * One column per day
  * Values separated by commas
* **State that we'll use the `numpy` library** to work with this in Python

----
**SLIDE** `PYTHON` LIBRARIES

* Most programming languages have **libraries** (or **modules**, or **packages**).
* **Libraries contain code that's not in the main language** but is useful for something specific - they can define **functions**, **data types**, and whole programs
* **Libraries add specific functionality to the language** - you import as many as you neeed
* `Python` has libraries for many types of work and operations
* **In `Python`, we call on libraries with the `import` statement, when we need them**
* Importing a library is like getting a new piece of equipment out of the locker and onto the lab bench
* **Import and describe libraries**

```python
import numpy
```

* `numpy` is a library that provides functions and pethods to work with arrays and matrices, such as those in your dataset

----
**SLIDE** LOAD DATA

```markdown
## Load data

Load comma-separated data from a file
```

* The `numpy` library gives us a function called **`loadtxt()` that loads tabular data from a file**
* To use a `function` from a `library`, **the format is usually `library.function()`: *dotted notation***
* **`loadtxt()` expects two *arguments* or *parameters*** - values it needs to know to work
* The parameter `fname` takes the **path to the file we want to load**
* The parameter `delimiter` takes the **character that we think separates columns** in that file

```python
numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
```

* **NOTE: This can be a good place to introduce tab-completion!**
* Here, our function is `numpy.loadtxt()`, and  *Dotted notation* tells us that `loadtxt()` belongs to `numpy`
* `Python` will accept **double- or single-quotes** around strings
* **EXECUTE THE CELL**

----
**SLIDE** LOADED DATA

* We didn't ask `Python` to do anything with the data, so it it just shows the data to us.
* The data display is truncated by default - *ellipses* (`...`) show rows and columns that were excluded for space 
* Significant digits are not shown
* **NOTE that integers in the file have been converted to floating point numbers**
* **Ask the learners to assign the matrix to a variable called `data`: MAKE THIS CHANGE IN-PLACE**

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname="data/inflammation-01.csv", delimiter=",")
```

* Now when we execute the cell **we see no output**, but `data` now contains the array, which we can see by **printing the variable**

```python
print(data)
```

----
**SLIDE** WHAT IS OUR DATA? **LIVE DEMO**

* We've loaded some data, but **what is it?**

```python
type(data)
```
* **`Python` sees our data as a special `type`: `numpy.ndarray`**
* From *dotted notation* we see that `ndarray` belongs to (was defined in) the `numpy` library
* `ndarray` stands for "n-dimensional array" - so this is **an n-dimensional array from the `numpy` library**

----
**SLIDE** MEMBERS AND ATTRIBUTES

* **Creating our `data` array created a lot of information, too**
* We created **information about the array** called *attributes*
* This information belongs to `data` so is **accessed in the same way as a module function**, through *dotted notation*

```python
print(data.dtype)
print(data.shape)
```

* `print(data.dtype)` tells us that the **data type for values in the array** is: 64-bit floating point numbers
* `print(data.shape)` tells us that there are **60 rows and 40 columns** in the dataset

----
**SLIDE** INDEXING ARRAYS

* **Take learners through making notes in the notebook: fence blocks**

```markdown
# Indexing arrays

Arrays are indexed by *row* and *column*, using *square bracket* notation:
```

* To get a single element from the array, **index using *square bracket* notation** - row first, then column

```python
data[30, 20] # get entry at row 30, column 20 of the array
```

* **Execute the cell**
* In **`Python` we index from zero**, so the first element is `data[0, 0]`

```python
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
print('middle value in data:', data[30, 20])
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** SLICING ARRAYS

* **Take learners through making notes in the notebook**

```markdown
## Slicing arrays

We select sections of an array by *slicing* it - defining the start and end points of the *slice* in square brackets, separating the start and end with `:` (colon)

The *slice* `0:4` means "start at index 0 and go up to, but not including, index 4"
```

* To get a section from the array, index using *square bracket* notation - but specify start and end points, separated by a colon
* The slice `0:4` means start at index zero and go up to, but not including, index 4. So it takes elements `0, 1, 2, 3` (four elements)
* **Do the two `print()` examples**

```python
print(data[0:4, 0:10])
print(data[5:10, 0:10])
print(data[2:4, 2:4])
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** MORE SLICES, PLEASE!

* If we don't specify a start for the slice, `Python` assumes the first element is meant (element zero)
* If we don't specify an end for the slice, `Python` assumes the last element is meant
* To get the top-right corner of the array, we can specify `data[:3, 36:]`
* **Demo the code**

```python
small = data[:3, 36:]
print('small is:')
print(small)
```

* **QUESTION: What does `:` on its own mean?**

```python
print(data[0:2, :])
```

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 04

* **PUT THE EXERCISE SLIDE ON SCREEN**
**MCQ: put up four colours of sticky notes**

* The value is `oxyg`, number `1`

**WHEN FINISHED, GO BACK TO THE NOTEBOOK AND PUT THE SLIDES ON THE DESKTOP**

----
**SLIDE** ARRAY OPERATIONS

```markdown
## Array operations

Arithmetic operations on arrays are performed *elementwise*

The `numpy` package provides functions that perform more complex operations on arrays.
```

* **Arithmetic operations on `array`s are performed elementwise.**

```python
doubledata = data * 2.0
```

* This operation multiplies every array element by 2.0.
* **Look at the top right corner of the original array**

```python
print('original:')
print(data[:3, 36:])
```

* **Look at the top right corner of the doubled array**

```
print('doubledata:')
print(doubledata[:3, 36:])
```

----
**SLIDE** `NUMPY` FUNCTIONS

* `numpy` provides functions that can perform *more complex* operations on arrays
* Some of the **`numpy` operations include statistical summaries: `.mean()`, `.min()`, `.max()` etc.**

```python
print(numpy.mean(data))
```

* We can asssign the output from these functions to variables
* **By default, these functions give summaries of the whole array**

```python
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data), numpy.min(data), numpy.std(data)
print('maximum inflammation:', maxval)
print('minimum inflammation:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** SUMMARY BY PATIENT

* **What if we want to get summaries patient-by-patient (row-by-row)?**
* We can extract a single row into a variable, and calculate the mean

```python
patient_0 = data[0, :] # Row zero only, all columns
print('maximum inflammation for patient 0:', patient_0.max())
```

* **NOTE: that comments are preceded with a hash `#` and can be placed after a line of code**
* * **EXPLAIN: why leaving comments is good (can do that in all code - not just Jupyter notebooks)**

* We can also **apply the `numpy` function directly**, without creating a variable

```python 
print('maximum inflammation for patient 0:', numpy.max(data[0, :]))
print('maximum inflammation for patient 2:', numpy.max(data[2, :]))
```

---- 
**SLIDE** SUMMARY OF ALL PATIENTS

* But **what if we want to know about all patients at once?**
* Or **what if we want an average inflammation per day?**
* Writing one line per row, or per column, is likely to lead to mistakes and typos
* **We can specify which axis a function applies to**

* **MOVE SLIDE TO SCREEN TO DEMONSTRATE AXES 0 AND 1**
* 
* Specifying `axis=0` makes the function work on columns (days)
* Specifying `axis=1` makes the function work on rows (patients)

* **RETURN NOTEBOOK TO SCREEN**

----
**SLIDE** `NUMPY` OPERATIONS ON AXES

* **`numpy` functions take an `axis=` parameter** which controls the axis for summary statistic calculations.

```python
print(numpy.max(data, axis=1))  # max value for each patient
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0)) # mean value on each day
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** VISUALISATION

----
**SLIDE** VISUALISATION

* **Start a new `markdown` notebook**

```markdown
# Visualisation

> "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers" - Richard Hamming

The best way to gain insight is often to visualise data.
```

* **Visualisation is a large topic that deserves more attention**

----
**SLIDE** `JUPYTER` MAGIC

* **`Jupyter` provides another way to control libraries, through *magics***
* `matplotlib` is the *de facto* standard plotting library in `Python`
* **Do the `matplotlib` magic**
* Note that warnings about fonts may be normal.

```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot
```

* **Import `numpy` and `seaborn`**
* `seaborn` is a library that enables attractive graphs and statistical summaries

```python
import numpy
import seaborn
```

----
**SLIDE** Load data

* We want to visualise our data, and so we need to load it into a variable in the notebook again
* **Load the data again**

```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
```

----
**SLIDE** `MATPLOTLIB` `.IMSHOW()` 

* The `.imshow()` function converts matrix values into an image

```python
image = matplotlib.pyplot.imshow(data)
```

* Here, small values are white, and large values are black (**you can change this colour scheme with other settings…**)
* From the image, we can see **inflammation rising and falling** over a 40-day period for all patients.
* **QUESTION: does this look reasonable?**

----
**SLIDE** `MATPLOTLIB` `.PLOT()`

* **`.plot()` shows a conventional line graph**
* We're going to use it to **plot the average inflammation level on each day of the study**
* We'll create the variable `ave_inflammation` and use `numpy.mean()` on axis `0` of the data

```python
ave_inflammation = numpy.mean(data, axis=0)
ave_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(ave_inflammation)
```

* **NOTE: ask students if the data looks reasonable?**
* The **data does not look reasonable**. Biologically, we expect a sharp rise in inflammation, followed by a slow tail-off

----
**SLIDE** INVESTIGATING DATA

* Since **our plot of `.mean()` values looks artificial, let's check on other statistics** to see if we can see what's going on.
* We'll plot the maximum value by day

```python
max_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
```
* **NOTE we're not defining a variable, this time**

```python
min_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
```

* **Ask students if the data looks reasonable?**
* The data looks very artificial. The maxima are completely smooth, but the minima are a step function.
* **NOTE: we would not have noticed this without visualisation**

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 05

* **PUT THE EXERCISE SLIDE ON SCREEN**

```python
std_plot = matplotlib.pyplot.plot(numpy.std(data, axis=0))
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

**WHEN FINISHED, GO BACK TO THE NOTEBOOK AND PUT THE SLIDES ON THE DESKTOP**

----
**SLIDE** FIGURES AND SUBPLOTS

* **THE CODE ALL NEEDS TO GO IN ONE CELL, BUT WE CAN EXECUTE AFTER EACH SECTION TO SHOW BUILD-UP**
* We can put all three plots we just drew into a single figure
* To do this, we use `matplotlib` to **create a figure**, and put it in a variable called `fig`

```python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))  # Create a figure object
```

* The `figsize` argument specifies the *width*, then the *height* of the figure being produced, in inches
* We then **create three *axes*** - these are the variables that hold the individual plots
* Using the `.add_subplot()` function, we need to specify three things:
  * number of rows, number of columns, which cell this figure goes into
  * **THIS NEEDS TO BE DRAWN OUT ON THE BOARD**

```python
axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)                     # Add three subplots
axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)
```

* Once we've created our plot axes, we can add labels and plots to each of them in turn
* Plot axes properties are usually changed using the `.set_<something>()` syntax
  * Here we're changing only the label on the *y*-axis

```python
axes1.set_ylabel('average')                          # Label the graphs
axes2.set_ylabel('max')
axes3.set_ylabel('min')
```
  
* We can plot on an axis by using its `.plot()` function
  * As before, we can pass the output from the `numpy.max()` function directly

```python
axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))                 # Plot the graphs
axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
```

* Finally, we'll tighten up the presentation by using `fig.tight_layout()` - a function that moves the axes until they are visually pleasing.

```python
fig.tight_layout()                                   # tidy the figure
```

* **This is the most demanding code you have written, so far! ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR YOURSELVES!**

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 06

* **PUT THE EXERCISE SLIDE ON SCREEN**

* Note that it helps to change `figsize`
* Otherwise the only change is in `add_subplot()`

```python
fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(3.0, 10.0))  # Create a figure object
axes1 = fig.add_subplot(3, 1, 1)                     # Add three subplots
axes2 = fig.add_subplot(3, 1, 2)
axes3 = fig.add_subplot(3, 1, 3)
axes1.set_ylabel('average')                          # Label and plot the graphs
axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
axes2.set_ylabel('max')
axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))
axes3.set_ylabel('min')
axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))
fig.tight_layout()                                   # tidy the figure
```

**SLIDE** LOOPS

----
**SLIDE** START A NEW NOTEBOOK

* Create a new notebook, and give it the name `loops`

```markdown
## Loops

*Loops* allow us to repeat operations on a series of items.
```

----
**SLIDE** MOTIVATION

* We wrote code that plots values of interest from our dataset
* **BUT** soon we're going to get **dozens of datasets** to analyse
* So, we need to tell the computer to **repeat our plots and analysis on each dataset**
* We're going to do this with `for` loops
* **NOTE: `for` loops are a fundamental method for program control across nearly every programming language**
* **NOTE: `for` loops in python work just like those the learners saw in `bash`, but are syntactically different**

----
**SLIDE** SPELLING BEE

* If we want to spell a word, like 'lead' one letter at a time

```python
word = "lead"
```

* We can *index* each letter in turn (just like elements of an array)

```python
print(word[0])
print(word[1])
print(word[2])
print(word[3])
```

* But this has some problems - **ASK LEARNERS WHAT PROBLEMS THEY SEE**
* The **approach doesn't scale** - what if our word is hundreds of letters long?
* **What if our word is longer than the indices?** We don't get all the data; if it's shorter, we get an error.
* **demonstrate with `oxygen` and `tin` - MODIFY THE WORD IN PLACE**

----
**SLIDE** `FOR` LOOPS

* **`for` loops perform an operation *for* every item *in* a collection**
* **REPLACE THE INDEXING AND DEMO FOR `oxygen`, `lead`, and `tin`**

```python
for char in word:
    print(char)
```

* Why is this better? **ASK THE LEARNERS**
* **It's shorter code** (less opportunity for error)
* **It's more flexible and robust** - it doesn't matter how long `word` is, the code will still spell it out one letter at a time
  
----
**SLIDE** BUILDING `FOR` LOOPS

* The general loop syntax is defined by a `for` statement, and a *code block*

```markdown
The general loop syntax is

for element in collection:
    <do something with element>
```

* The `for` loop **statement ends in a colon, `:`**
* The *code block* is **indented** with a `tab` (`\t`)
  * **Everything indented immediately below the `for` statement is part of the `for` loop**
  * **There is no command or statement to signify the end of the loop body - only a change in indentation**
  * This is quite different from most other languages (and some people hate `Python` because of it)
* **DEMO THE CODE BELOW**

```python
for char in word:
    print(char)
    print("I'm in the loop")
    # This is a comment
    print("Still in the loop")
    
    print("I'm in the loop as well")
print("Not in the loop")
```

----
**SLIDE** COUNTING THINGS

* Code in a `for` loop can still see variables defined outside the loop
* **PUT THE CODE INTO A CELL:**

```python
length = 0
for vowel in 'aeiou':
    length = length + 1
print('There are', length, 'vowels')
```

* **Ask the learners what output they expect**
* Talk through the operations of the loop, if necessary

----
**SLIDE** LOOP VARIABLES

* The *loop variable* alsp still exists once the loop is finished
* **PUT CODE IN A CELL**

```python
letter = 'z'
print(letter)
for letter in 'abc':
    print(letter)
print('after the loop, letter is', letter)
```

* **ASK THE LEARNERS WHAT OUTPUT THEY EXPECT**
* The value of `letter` is `c`, the last updated value in the loop - not `z`, which would be the case if the loop variable only had scope within the loop

----
**SLIDE** `RANGE()`

* **Make a markdown cell**

```markdown
## `range()`

The `range()` function creates a sequence of numbers
```

* The `range()` function creates a **sequence of numbers.**
* The sequence depends on the number and value of arguments given
* **RUN DEMO CODE BELOW**

```python
seq = range(3)
print("Range is:", seq)
for val in seq:
    print(val)
```

* **Substitute other ranges and run again**

```python
seq = range(3)
seq = range(2, 5)
seq = range(3, 10, 3)
seq = range(10, 0, -1)
```

* A single value *n* gives the sequence `[0, ..., n-1]`
* Two values: *m, n* gives the sequence `[m, ..., n-1]`
* Three values: *m, n, p* gives the sequence `[m, m+p, ..., n-1]` and skips `n-1` if it's not in the sequence.
* **NOTE: `range()` returns a `range` type that can be iterated over.**

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 07

* **PUT THE EXERCISE SLIDE ON SCREEN**

```python
result = 1
for val in range(3):
    result = result * 5
print(result)
```

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 08

```python
instr = "Newton"
outstr = ""
for char in instr:
    outstr =  char + outstr
print(outstr)
```
**WHEN FINISHED, GO BACK TO THE NOTEBOOK AND PUT THE SLIDES ON THE DESKTOP**

----
**SLIDE** `enumerate()`

```markdown
## `enumerate()`

The `enumerate()` function creates paired indices and values for elements of a sequence
```

* **DEMO CODE BELOW**

```python
seq = enumerate('aeiou')
print("Sequence is:", seq)
for idx, val in seq:
    print(idx, val)
 ```

----
**SLIDE** USING `enumerate()`

* We can use enumerate to index lists in order, which can be very useful in a variety of circumstances
* **PUT THE MARKDOWN IN THE NOTEBOOK**

```markdown
Calculate $y$ when $x=5$ when the coefficients are `coeffs = [2, 4, 3, 2, 1]`:

$$y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + a_4 x^4$$
```

We can solve this with a little `Python`

```python
x = 5
coeffs = [2, 4, 3, 2, 1]

y = 0
for idx, val in enumerate(coeffs):
    y = y + val * (x ** idx)

print(y)
```

----
**SLIDE** LISTS

----
**SLIDE** START A NEW NOTEBOOK

```markdown
# Lists

Lists are a built-in `Python` datatype, describing ordered collections of elements.

Lists are defined by comma-separated values, in square brackets.
``` 

----
**SLIDE** LISTS

* Lists are defined as ordered lists of values, in square brackets, separated by commas

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print('odds are:', odds)
```

* They can be indexed and sliced, as seen for arrays

```python
print('first and last:', odds[0], odds[-1])
print(odds[2:])
```

* They can be iterated over, in loops

```python
for number in odds:
    print(number)
```

----
**SLIDE** MUTABILITY

```markdown
## Mutability

`Python` has a concept of mutability. Items that can be changed in-place are *mutable*. Those that can't are *immutable*.

Lists are *mutable*, strings are *immutable*.
```

* `list`s and `string`s are both sequences, **BUT** you can change the elements in a list, after it is created: **lists are mutable**

```python
names = ['Newton', 'Darwing', 'Turing'] # typo in Darwin's name
print('names is originally:', names)
```

* **We have a typo - let's correct it**

```
names[1] = 'Darwin' # correct the name
print('final value of names:', names)
```

* `string`s are **NOT** mutable

```python
name = 'Darwin'
name[0] = 'd'
```

----
**SLIDE** CHANGER DANGER

* **There are risks associated with modifying lists in-place**
* Rather than make copies of lists, when assigned to more than one variable, `Python` will make *reference* to the original list
* **DEMO CODE**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
your_list = my_list
print("my list:", my_list)
my_list[1] = 0
```

* **ASK LEARNERS WHAT THEY THINK `your_list` contains**

```python
print("your list:", your_list)
```

* If two variables refer to the same list, any changes to that list are reflected in both variables.

----
**SLIDE** LIST COPIES

* To a**void this kind of effect, you can make a *copy* of a `list` by *slicing* it**, or using the `list()` function that returns a new list
* **DEMO CODE - MODIFY THE CODE ABOVE IN-PLACE IN THE NOTEBOOK **

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
your_list = my_list[:]
print("my list:", my_list)
print("your list:", your_list)
my_list[1] = 0
print("my list:", my_list)
print("your list:", your_list)
```

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
your_list = list(my_list)
print("my list:", my_list)
print("your list:", your_list)
my_list[1] = 0
print("my list:", my_list)
print("your list:", your_list)
```

----
**SLIDE** NESTED LISTS

* **ADD MARKDOWN CELL**

```markdown
## Nested `list`s and `list` functions

A `list` can contain any other datatype - even another `list`!
```

* **`list`s can contain any datatype, even other lists**
* Imagine we have a grocery store with three shelves, and the items on the shelves are arranged with {pepper, zucchini, onion} on the top shelf, {cabbage, lettuce, garlic} on the middle shelf, and {apple, pear, banana} on the lower shelf. 
* **We can represent this in a *nested list***: one list per shelf, and a list that contains the three lists, to represent the grocery store.
* **Demo code**

```python
shelves = [['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion'],
           ['cabbage', 'lettuce', 'garlic'],
           ['apple', 'pear', 'banana']]
```

**NOTE: This should remind you of the `numpy` array you loaded earlier!**
**Work through the code below**

```python
print(shelves[0])
print([shelves[0]])
print(shelves[0][0])
```

----
**SLIDE** `LIST` FUNCTIONS

* `list`s are `Python` objects and have a number of useful functions to modify their contents
* `.append()` adds a value to the end of the list

```python
odds.append(9)
print("odds after adding a value:", odds)
```

* `.reverse()` reverses the order of list items

```python
odds.reverse()
print("odds after reversing:", odds)
```

* `.pop()` returns the last item in the list, removing it from the list

```python
print(odds.pop())
print("odds after popping:", odds)
```

----
**SLIDE** OVERLOADING

* We can add (`+`) and multiply (`*`) lists, even though they're not really arithmetic operations
* *Overloading* refers to an *operator* (e.g. `+`) having more than one meaning, depending on the thing it operates on.


```python
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
vowels_welsh = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'w', 'y']
print(vowels + vowels_welsh)
```

* **NOTE: multiplication of lists does not work like multiplication of `numpy` arrays**

```python
counts = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
repeats = counts * 2
print(repeats)
```

* **Ask the learners what 'addition' (`+`) and 'multiplication' (`*`) do for lists**

----
**SLIDE** MAKING CHOICES

----
**SLIDE** START A NEW NOTEBOOK

* **Call it `choices`**
* **Add an introduction cell**

```markdown
# Making Choices

We often want to make the computer perform one task if some condition is true, but a different task if that condition is false.
```

* **Add the Python code to the markdown**

```python
if <condition>:
  <executed if condition is True>
```

----
**SLIDE** CONDITIONALS

* We often want the computer to do `<something>` **`if`** some condition is **true**
* To do this, we can use an **`if` statement**
  * **`if` statements end in a colon (`:`)**
  * **they also have a *condition*** - the *condition* is evaluated and, if found to be `true`, the code block is executed
  * The code block is *indented* as was the case with the `for` loop

* **EXECUTE CODE**

```python
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
print('done')
```

* **CHANGE NUMBER TO VARIOUS VALUES IN THE SAME CELL**

```python
num = 137
num = 100
```

* **Any condition** that might evaluate to `True` or `False` can be used:
* **SHOW A DIFFERENT TEST**

```python
if 'atlas' == 'atlas':
    print("the same")
```

----
**SLIDE** `IF-ELSE` STATEMENTS

* **An `if` statement executes code if the condition evaluates as `true`**
* But **what if the condition evaluates as `false`?**
* The **`else` structure** is like the `if` structure
  * it **ends in a colon (`:`)**
  * the **indented code block beneath it executes if the condition is `false`**
* **MAKE CHANGES AND EXECUTE CODE IN EXISTING CELLS**

```python
num = 37
if num > 100:
    print('greater')
else:
    print('not greater')
print('done')
```

```python
if 'atlas' == 'atlash':
    print("the same")
else:
    print('different')
```

----
**SLIDE** CONDITIONAL LOGIC

* **OPTIONALLY SHOW THIS SLIDE**

* Describe flowchart

----
**SLIDE** `IF-ELIF-ELSE` CONDITIONALS

* We can **chain conditional tests together with `elif` (short for `else if`)**
* The `elif` statement structure is the same as the `if` statement structure 
  * the indented code block is executed if the condition is true, and **no previous conditions have been met**.
* **EXECUTE DEMO CODE IN EXISTING CELL**

```python
num = -3
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is positive")
elif num == 0:
    print(num, "is zero")
else:
    print(num, "is negative")
```

* **NOTE: the test for equality is a double-equals!**

* We can **combine conditions using *Boolean Logic***
* Operators include `and`, `or` and `not`
* **EXECUTE CODE IN NEW CELL**

```python

**SLIDE** MORE OPERATORS

* **ADD THE MARKDOWN**

```markdown
## Operators

* `==` (equals)
* `in`
```

* These are **two operators** you will meet and use frequently
* `==` **(double-equals) is the equality operator**, and returns `True` if the left-hand-side value is equal to the right-hand-side value
* **DEMO CODE**

```python
print(1 == 1)
print(1 == 2)
```

* `in` is the **membership operator**, and returns `True` if the left-hand-side value is in the right-hand-side value
* **DEMO CODE**

```python
print('a' in 'toast')
print('b' in 'toast')
print(1 in [1, 2, 3])
print(1 in range(3))
print(1 in range(2, 10))
```

* **Call it `files`**
* **ADD NEW HEADER CELL**

```markdown
# Analysing Multiple Files

We're now almost ready to start analysing multiple files of inflammation data.
```

* **ADD IMPORTS**

```python
%matplotlib inline

import matplotlib.pyplot
import numpy
import seaborn
```

----
**SLIDE** ANALYSING MULTIPLE FILES

* We have **received several files of data** from the inflammation studies, and we would like to **perform the same operations on each of them**.
* We have **learned how to open files, read data, visualise data, loop over data, and make decisions** based on that content.
* Now we need to know how to **interact with the *filesystem*** to get our data files.

-----
**SLIDE** THE `OS` MODULE

* **New Markdown cell**

```markdown
## The `os` module

Allows us to interact with the computer's filesystem
```

* To interact with the filesystem, **we need to import the `os` module**
* This allows us to interact with the filesystem in the same way, regardless of the operating system we work on! **INTEROPERABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY**
* **IMPORT THE MODULE**

```python
import os
```

----
**SLIDE** `OS.LISTDIR`

* The `.listdir()` function lists the contents of a directory

```python
os.listdir('.')
```

* Our data is in the `'data'` directory
* **Reuse the cell**

```python
os.listdir('data')
```

* **We only want `inflammation` data** so we would like to ignore the `small` files
* We want to turn the list from `os.listdir()` into a list that contains only `inflammation*` files: **use `for` loop and `if` to filter**
* The list can be filtered with a `for` loop or *list comprehension*

```python
for file in os.listdir('data'):
    if 'inflammation' in file:
        print(file)
```

* We'd like to work with this set of files, so we store it in a variable, called `files`.
* A suitable data type here is a `list`, and we can populate it one file at a time, using `.append()`
* **ADAPT THE EXISTING CELL**

```python
files = []
for file in os.listdir('data'):
    if 'inflammation' in file:
        files.append(file)
print(files)
```

----
**SLIDE** `OS.PATH.JOIN`

* The **`os.listdir()` function only returns filenames**, not the *path* (relative or absolute) to those files.
* **WE NEED THE FULL PATH TO A FILE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT**
* To **construct a path**, we can use the `os.path.join()` function. 
* `os.path.join()` takes directory and file names, and returns a path built from them as a string, suitable for the underlying operating system.
* **This is useful for making code shareable and usable on all OS/computers**
* **EXAMPLE CODE IN NEW CELL**

```python
os.path.join('parent', 'child', 'file.txt')
os.path.join('data', 'inflammation-01.csv')
```

* **MODIFY PREVIOUS CELL TO GET**

```python
files = []
for file in os.listdir('data'):
    if 'inflammation' in file:
        files.append(os.path.join('data', file))
print(files)
```

----
**SLIDE** VISUALISING THE DATA

* **Add markdown**

```markdown
## Visualising data

We can now load data from each file in turn, and visualise the mean, minimum and maximum values in an array of plots
```

* Now **we have all the tools we need** to load all the inflammation data files, and visualise the mean, minimum and maximum values in an array of plots.
  * We can get a **list of paths to the data files** with `os` and a *list comprehension*
  * We can **load data from a file** with `numpy.loadtxt()`
  * We can **calculate summary statistics** with `numpy.mean()`, `numpy.max()`, etc.
  * We can **create figures** with `matplotlib`, and arrays of figures with `.add_subplot()`

----
**SLIDE** VISUALISATION CODE

* **BUILD THE CODE IN STAGES**

* **1 - show that we see each filename in turn**
```python
for file in files:

    print(file)
    
    # load data
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file, delimiter=',')
    print(data)
```

* **3 - create a figure for each file**

```python
for file in files:
    print(file)

    # load data
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file, delimiter=',')

    # create figure and axes
    fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))
    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)
```

* **4 - decorate the axes**
