# LESSON 02 - Building Programs With Python

These notes are a guide to the speaker, as they present the material.

## Before you start

* Test your `Jupyter` installation and make sure you can connect to the kernel.

## Slides

----
**SLIDE** Building Programs With Python (1)

----
**SLIDE** INTRODUCTION

----
**SLIDE** WHY ARE WE HERE?

* We're here to learn **how to program**
* This is a way to **solve problems in your research** through making a computer do work **quickly** and **accurately**
* You'll build **functions** that do specific, defined tasks
* You'll **automate** those functions to perform tasks over and over again (in various combinations)
* You'll **manipulate data**, which is at the heart of all academia
* You'll learn some **file input/output** to make the computer read and write useful information
* You'll learn some **Data structures**, which are ways to organise data so that the computer can deal with it efficiently

----
**SLIDE** XKCD

* Again, this slide is only a little bit flippant
* *No-one* writes perfect code, first time
* It's all about revision, and good practice: **defensive programming**
* This will make your life, and other people's lives, much easier

----
**SLIDE** WHAT ARE WE DOING?

* We're using **a motivating example of data analysis**
* We've got some data relating to a new treatment for arthritis, and we're going to **explore it.**
* Data represents patients and **daily measurements of inflammation**
* We're going to **refactor** our code from yesterday
* We're going to **document** what the code does
* We're going to **catch errors** in our code, and respond sensibly

----
**SLIDE** SETUP

----
**SLIDE** SETTING UP

* We want a neat (clean) working environment
* **IF NECESSARY!**
* Change directory to desktop (in terminal or Explorer)
* Change your working directory to `python-novice-inflammation` (from yesterday/earlier)

----
**SLIDE** STARTING `JUPYTER` **DEMO**

* Start `Jupyter` from the command-line

----
**SLIDE** `JUPYTER` LANDING PAGE **DEMO**

* Landing page is a file browser, like Explorer/Finder
* **MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS IN THE CORRECT LOCATION**

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** FUNCTIONS

----
**SLIDE** MOTIVATION

* We wrote some code that plots values of interest from multiple datasets, but that code is long and complicated
* The code is also not very flexible if we want to deal with thousands of files, and we can't modify it to plot only a subset of files very easily
* Cutting and pasting is slow and error-prone
* **SO** we will package our code for reuse.
* **We do this by writing functions**

----
**SLIDE** WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

* Functions in code work **like mathematical functions**, like `y=f(x)`
* `f()`  is the function
* `x`  is an **input** (or inputs)
* `y`  is the **returned value**, or output(s)
* The function's output  `y`  depends in some way on the value of  `x`  - defined by  `f()`.
* **Not all functions in code take an input, or produce a usable output, but the principle is generally the same.**
* **You've already been using functions in this course: `print()`, `numpy.max()`, etc.**

----
**SLIDE** MY FIRST FUNCTION

* **TALK ABOUT THE FUNCTION AND ITS PARTS BEFORE CREATING IT**
* We'll write a function to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin, called `fahr_to_kelvin()`
* **Describe the mathematical function**:
  * This function takes `x`, subtracts 32, multiplies by 5/9, and adds 273.15
* In `Python` this **translates to the code below**:
  * The function **performs a calculation, which is *returned* by the `return` statement**.
  * The value of **the variable `temp` is taken through the same calculation as in the mathematical function**, and is then *return*ed.
  * Functions are *defined* by the `def` keyword
  * The name of the function follows the `def` keyword (equivalent to `f` in the mathematical example)
  * The first line ends in a colon, just like a `for` loop or `if` statement.
  * The code, or *body* of the function is indented, just like a `for` loop or `if` statement.
  * The *parameters* or *inputs* to the function are then defined in parentheses. These get a variable name **which only exists within the function**. Here, there is one parameter, called `temp`.

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK **DEMO**

* **PUT THE NOTEBOOK ON SCREEN**

* We'll create a new notebook to play with some functions
* Call the notebook `functions`
* **Add a header**

```markdown
# Functions

Functions are pieces of code that take an input and return an output. They enable us to break our code into logical chunks that are easier to understand and maintain.
```

----
**SLIDE** CREATE THE FUNCTION

* **WRITE THE FUNCTION IN THE NOTEBOOK**

```python
```

----
**SLIDE** CALLING THE FUNCTION

* We **call `fahr_to_kelvin` in exactly the same way we call any other function we've seen** so far
* e.g. `print()` or `numpy.mean()`

```python
print('freezing point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(32))
print('boiling point of water:', fahr_to_kelvin(212))
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW FUNCTION

* **ASK THE LEARNERS HOW WE WOULD CREATE A NEW FUNCTION TO CONVERT KELVIN TO CELSIUS**
* **Walk through the process, being prompted**

```python
def kelvin_to_celsius(temp):
  return temp - 273.15
```

* **ASK THE LEARNERS HOW TO CALL THE FUNCTION**

```python
print('freezing point of water', kelvin_to_celsius(273.15))
```

----
**SLIDE** COMPOSING FUNCTIONS

* **Composing `Python` functions works just like mathematical functions**: `y = f(g(x))`
* **ASK HOW WE CAN CONVERT FAHRENHEIT TO CELSIUS WITH OUR EXISTING FUNCTIONS**
* We could convert a temperature in fahrenheit (`temp_f`) to a temperature in celsius (`temp_c`) by **executing the code**:

```python
temp_f = 212.0
temp_c = kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f))
print(temp_c)
```

----
**SLIDE** NEW FUNCTIONS FROM OLD

* **ASK LEARNERS HOW WE CAN TURN THIS INTO A NEW FUNCTION: `fahr_to_celsius()`:

```python
def fahr_to_celsius(temp_f):
    return kelvin_to_celsius(fahr_to_kelvin(temp_f))
```

* We can call this just like any other function
   
```python 
print('freezing point of water in Celsius:', fahr_to_celsius(32.0))
```

* **THIS IS HOW PROGRAMS ARE BUILT: COMBINING SMALL CHUNKS OF CODE INTO LARGER BITS UNTIL WE GET THE RESULT WE WANT**

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 01

* **SHOW THE SLIDES FOR THE EXERCISE**

```python
def outer(s)
    return s[0] + s[-1]
```

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

* **RETURN TO THE NOTEBOOK**

----
**SLIDE** SCOPE

* **Make a Markdown note**

```markdown
## Scope

Variables defined within a function (including parameters) are not available outside the function unless they are returned.
```

* **This is called *function scope***
* **DEMO THE CODE BELOW**

```python
a = "Hello"

print(a)
```

* This code defines a variable `a` and gives it a value "Hello"
* **NOW DECLARE A FUNCTION (IN THE SAME CELL) AND CALL IT**

```python
a = "Hello"

def my_fn():
    a = "Goodbye"
    return a

a = my_fn()
print(a)
```

* To move values to and from functions, you should generally `return` them from the function
* **COMPLETE THE CODE EXAMPLE IN THE CELL**

```python
a = "Hello"

def my_fn(a):
  a = "Goodbye"
  
a = my_fn(a)
print(a)
```

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 02

* **PUT THE SLIDES ON SCREEN**
* **MCQ: put coloured stickies up**

* Solution: `1: 7 3` (this differs from that on the SWC page)

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

* **PUT THE NOTEBOOK BACK ON SCREEN WHEN DONE**

----
**SLIDE** ANALYSIS

----
**SLIDE** TIDYING UP

* Now we can write functions, **let's make the inflammation analysis easier to reuse**
* **ONE FUNCTION PER OPERATION**
* **OPEN UP THE `FILES.IPYNB` NOTEBOOK FROM YESTERDAY
* **RESTART AND RUN ALL CELLS**
* **GUIDE THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE CODE LOGIC: TWO SECTIONS - ANALYSE AND DETECT PROBLEMS**

----
**SLIDE** `ANALYSE()`

* We'll write **a function that plots the data**
* **WRITE THE FUNCTION BELOW IN THE SAME CELL, WITH COPY AND PASTE**
* **SPLIT CELLS SO THAT THE FUNCTION AND LOOP ARE SEPARATE**

```python
def analyze(data):
    fig = matplotlib.pyplot.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

    axes1.set_ylabel('average')
    axes1.plot(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))

    axes2.set_ylabel('max')
    axes2.plot(numpy.max(data, axis=0))

    axes3.set_ylabel('min')
    axes3.plot(numpy.min(data, axis=0))

    fig.tight_layout()
    matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

**RUN THE CELL AND SHOW THAT THE OUTPUT IS THE SAME**

----
**SLIDE** `DETECT_PROBLEMS()`

* We'll have **a function that checks the data for problems**
*  * **Demo code**

```python
def detect_problems(data):
    if numpy.max(data, axis=0)[0] == 0 and numpy.max(data, axis=0)[20] == 20:
        print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
    elif numpy.sum(numpy.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
        print('Minima add up to zero!')
    else:
        print('Seems OK!')
```

**RUN THE CELL AND SHOW THAT THE OUTPUT IS THE SAME**

----
**SLIDE** CODE REUSE

* **The logic of the code is now easier to understand**
* We identify the input files, then apply one function per action in a loop:
  * Print the filename
  * Load the data with `np.loadtxt()`
  * `detect_problems()` in the data
  * `analyse()` the data


```python
for file in files:
    print(file)
    data = numpy.loadtxt(fname=file, delimiter=',')
    detect_problems(data)
    analyse(data)    
```

* **THIS HAS ADVANTAGES**
* **The code is much shorter (as we read it, here)**
* **The function names are human-readable and descriptive**
* **It is much easier to see what the code is doing**

![progress check](images/red_green_sticky.png)

----
**SLIDE** GOOD CODE PAYS OFF

* **PUT SLIDES ON SCREEN**
* **YOU MAY BE ASKING YOURSELF WHY YOU WANT TO BOTHER WITH THIS**

* After 6 months, the referee report arrives and you need to rerun experiments
* Another student is continuing the project
* Some random person reads your article and asks for the code
* Helps spot errors quickly
* Clarifies structure in your mind as well as in the code
* Saves you time in the long run! ("Future You" will back this up)

----
**SLIDE** TESTING AND DOCUMENTATION

----
**SLIDE** MOTIVATION

* Once a useful function is written, it gets reused over and over, often without further checking
* When you write a function you should:
  * **Test output for correctness**
  * **Document the expected function**
* We'll demonstrate this with a function to centre a numerical array

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK

* **New notebook called `testing`**
* **ADD AN INTRO IN MARKDOWN**

```markdown
# Testing and Documentation

When writing a function, we should

* test output for correctness
* document the expected function
```

* **ADD IMPORTS**

```python
import numpy
```

* **Write the test function**
* When doing some analyses, such as PCA, we might want to recentre and normalise our dataset.
* Let's write a function to recentre an array of data, like the inflammation data.

```python
def centre(data, desired):
    return (data - np.mean(data)) + desired
```

----
**SLIDE** TEST DATASETS

* **ASK THE LEARNERS HOW WE CAN CHECK THAT THE FUNCTION WORKS IN THE WAY WE INTEND**

* We could try `centre()` on our real data, but we *don't know what the answer should be!**
* We'll use `numpy`'s `zeros()` function to generate an **input set where we know the answer**
* **SHOW THE TEST DATA**

```python
z = np.zeros((2, 2))
z
```

* **Let's recentre the data at the value 2**

```python
centre(z, 3.0)
```

* **This works, so we'll try it on real data**


----
**SLIDE** REAL DATA

* **LOAD THE DATA**
* 
```python
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='data/inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
```

* **Let's recentre the data to zero**

```python
centre(data, 0))
```

* This looks OK, but **how would we know it worked?**

----
**SLIDE** CHECK PROPERTIES

* **ASK LEARNERS HOW THEY COULD VERIFY THE FUNCTION WORKED AS INTENDED**
* We can **check properties of the original and centred data**
  * `mean`, `min`, `max`, `std`

```python
print('original min, mean, and max are:', numpy.min(data), numpy.mean(data), numpy.max(data))
```
  
* We'd expect the **mean of the new dataset to be approximately `0.0`**
* Also, the **range (`max` - `min`) should be unchanged.**

```python
centred = centre(data, 0)
print('min, mean, and max of centered data are:', numpy.min(centred),
      numpy.mean(centred), numpy.max(centred))  
```

* The limits seem OK, but has the *shape* of the data distribution changed?
* The **variance of the dataset should be unchanged.**

```python
print('std dev before and after:', numpy.std(data), numpy.std(centred))    
```

* The range and variance are as expected, but the mean is not quite `0.0`
* **The function is probably OK, as-is**

----
**SLIDE** DEFAULT ARGUMENTS

* So far we have named the two arguments in our `centre()` function
* We need to specify both of them when we call the function
* **Demo code**

```python
centre([1, 2, 3], 0)
```

* We **can set a *default* value for function arguments** when we define the function
* Set defaults **by assigning a value in the function declaration**, as follows:

```python
def centre(data, desired=0.0):
    """Returns the array in data, recentered around the desired value."""
    return (data - np.mean(data)) + desired
```

* The change we've made is to set `desired=0.0` in the function *prototype*.
* Now, by default, the function will recentre the passed data to zero, without us having to specify that:

```python
centre([1, 2, 3])
```

----
**SLIDE** DOCUMENTING FUNCTIONS

* **ADD TEXT TO THE NOTEBOOK**

```markdown
## Documentation

We can document what our code is meant to do in several ways

* writing comments in the code
* writing docstrings
* writing documentation documents
```

* We can document what our function does by **writing comments in the code**, and this is a good thing.
* But Python allows us to **document what a function does directly in the function** using a *docstring*.
* This is a string that is put in a **specific place in the function definition, and it has special properties that are useful**.
* To add a docstring to our `centre()` function, we add a string immediately after the function declaration
* **ADD DOCSTRING TO EXISTING FUNCTION AND RUN CELL**

```python
def centre(data, desired):
    """Returns the array in data, recentered around the desired value."""
    return (data - numpy.mean(data)) + desired
```

* **RESTART KERNEL AND RUN ALL**
* This documents the function directly in the source code, and it also **hooks that documentation into `Python`'s `help` system.**
* We can ask for help on any function using the `help()` function:
* built-in function

```python
help(print)
```

* module function

```python
help(numpy.mean)
```

* and **if you write it** your own functions

```python
help(centre)
```

* **SHOW LEARNERS HOW DETAILED THE BUILTIN AND NUMPY HELP IS**
* Using the triple quotes (""") allows us to use a multi-line string to describe the function:
* **ADD EXTRA DOCUMENTATION**

```python
def centre(data, desired):
    """Returns the array in data, recentred around the desired value.
    
    Example
    -------
    >>> centre([1, 2, 3], 0)
    [-1, 0, 1]
    """
    return (data - numpy.mean(data)) + desired
```

* **DEMONSTRATE THE CHANGE**

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 03

* **MOVE SLIDES TO THE SCREEN**

```python
def rescale(data):
    """Returns input array rescaled to [0.0, 0.1]."""
    l = numpy.min(data)
    h = numpy.max(data)
    return (data - l) / (h - l)
```

**SLIDE** ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS

* **MOVE NOTEBOOK TO THE SCREEN**

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK

* **Call the notebook `errors`**
* **ADD AN INTRO**

```markdown
# Errors and Exceptions

`Python` provides useful error reports of what has gone wrong, which can help with debugging.
```

----
**SLIDE** ERRORS

* **Programming is essentially just making errors over and over again until the code works** ;)
* The key skill is **learning how to identify, and then fix, the errors** when they are reported.
* **All programmers** make errors. 

----
**SLIDE** TRACEBACK

* `Python` tries to be helpful, and provides extensive information about errors
* These are called *tracebacks*
* **We'll induce a traceback, so we can look at it**
* **ENTER CODE IN A CELL**

```python
def favourite_ice_cream():
    ice_creams = ["chocolate",
                  "vanilla",
                  "strawberry"]
    print(ice_creams[3])
```

* **NEW CELL**

```
favourite_ice_cream()
```

----
**SLIDE** PARTS OF A TRACEBACK

```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-8f18c934933f> in <module>()
----> 1 favourite_ice_cream()

<ipython-input-3-3f8910a0f7ad> in favourite_ice_cream()
      3                   "vanilla",
      4                   "strawberry"]
----> 5     print(ice_creams[3])

IndexError: list index out of range

```

* **TALK THROUGH THE TRACEBACK IN THE NOTEBOOK**
* The *stack* of all steps leading to the error is shown
* The steps are separated by lines starting `<ipython-input-1…`
* The steps run in order from top to bottom
* The first step has an arrow, showing where we were when the error happened. We were calling the `favourite_ice_cream()` function
* The second step tells us that we were *in* the `favourite_ice_cream()` function
* The second step also points to the line `print(ice_creams[3])`, which is where the error occurs
* This is also the last step, and the precise error is shown on the final line: `IndexError: list index out of range`
* Together, this tells us that we have made an index error in the line `print(ice_creams[3])`, and by looking we can see that we've tried to use an index outside the length of the list.

----
**SLIDE** SYNTAX ERRORS

* **The error you saw just now was a *logic error*** - the code was valid `Python`, but it did something 'illegal'
* ***Syntax* errors occur when the code is not interpretable as valid `Python`**
* **ENTER CODE IN A NEW CELL - NOTE THE EXTRA SPACE AND LACK OF COLON!**

```python
def some_function()
    msg = "hello, world!"
    print(msg)
     return msg
```

----
**SLIDE** SYNTAX TRACEBACK

```python
  File "<ipython-input-6-bef8c18baffa>", line 1
    def some_function()
                       ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

* `Python` tells us there's a `SyntaxError` - the code isn't written correctly
* It points to the approximate location of the problem with a caret/hat (`^`)
* We can see that we need to put a colon at the end of the function declaration
* **FIX THE CODE IN PLACE**

----
**SLIDE** FIXED?

* **SHOW AND RUN FIXED CODE**

```python
def some_function():
    msg = "hello, world!"
    print(msg)
     return msg
```

----
**SLIDE** NOT QUITE

```python
  File "<ipython-input-7-b32ba7f38b6b>", line 4
    return msg
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

* `Python` now tells us that there's an `IndentationError`
* We don't learn about all the syntax errors at one time - `Python` gives up after the first one it finds
* **(fixing the first error in a file might correct all subsequent errors)**

----
**SLIDE** NAME ERRORS

* If you try to use a variable that is not defined in *scope*, you will get a `NameError`
* This often happens with typos
* **ENTER CODE IN A NEW CELL**

```python
print(a)
```

* We have a **NAME ERROR**

```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-c5a4f3535135> in <module>()
----> 1 print(a)

NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

* **This is true in functions/loops, too**
* **ENTER CODE IN A NEW CELL**

```python
for i in range(3):
    count = count + i
```

* This still gives us a name error


```python
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-6-15ebe951e74d> in <module>()
      1 for i in range(3):
----> 2     count = count + i

NameError: name 'count' is not defined
```

----
**SLIDE** INDEX ERRORS

* If you try to access an element of a collection that does not exist, you'll get an `IndexError`
* **ENTER CODE IN NEW CELL**

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for letter in range(4):
    print("Letter", letter, "is", letters[letter])
```

* **This gives us an `IndexError`**

```
Letter #1 is a
Letter #2 is b
Letter #3 is c
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-7-656a22fa6ec5> in <module>()
      3 print("Letter #2 is", letters[1])
      4 print("Letter #3 is", letters[2])
----> 5 print("Letter #4 is", letters[3])

IndexError: list index out of range
```

----
**SLIDE** EXERCISE 04

* **PUT SLIDES ON SCREEN**

```python
message = ""
for number in range(10):
    # use a if the number is a multiple of 3, otherwise use b
    if (number % 3) == 0:
        message = message + "a"
    else:
        message = message + "b"
print(message)
```

**SLIDE** DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING

----
**SLIDE** CREATE A NEW NOTEBOOK

----
**SLIDE** DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING

* So far we have focused on the basic tools of writing a program: variables, lists, loops, conditionals, and functions.
* We haven't looked very much at whether a program is getting the right answer (and whether it continues to get the right answer as we change it).
* **It's all very well having some code, but if it doesn't give the right answer it can be damaging, or useless**
* **Defensive programming** is the practice of expecting your code to have mistakes, and guarding against them.
* To do this, we will write some code that *checks its own operation*.
* This is generally good practice, that speeds up software development and helps ensure that your code is doing what you intend.

----
**SLIDE** ASSERTIONS

* Assertions are a `Pythonic` way to see if code runs correctly
    * 10-20% of the `Firefox` source code is assertions/checks on the rest of the code!
* We `assert` that a *condition* is `True`
    * If it's `True`, the code may be correct
    * If it's `False`, the code is **not** correct
* The syntax for an assertion is that we `assert` some `<condition>` is `True`, and if it's not, an error is thrown (`AssertionError`), with some text explaining the problem.
    
```python
assert <condition>, "Some text describing the problem"
```

----
**SLIDE** EXAMPLE ASSERTION

* Type code **then ask learners what it does**

```python
numbers = [1.5, 2.3, 0.7, -0.001, 4.4]
total = 0.0
for n in numbers:
    assert n > 0.0, 'Data should only contain positive values'
    total += n
print('total is:', total)
```

* **Demo code**

```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-985f50018947> in <module>()
      2 total = 0.0
      3 for n in numbers:
----> 4     assert n > 0.0, 'Data should only contain positive values'
      5     total += n
      6 print('total is:', total)

AssertionError: Data should only contain positive values
```

* The traceback tells us which *assertion* failed.
